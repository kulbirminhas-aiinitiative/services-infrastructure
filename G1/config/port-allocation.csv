# OOM Platform Comprehensive Port Allocation Configuration
# =============================================================================
# This file defines the complete port allocation strategy for all OOM services
# 
# Port Allocation Strategy:
# - Infrastructure Services: 5000-5999
# - Core Application Services: 4000-4999  
# - AI/ML Services: 6000-6999
# - Business Services: 7000-7999
# - Security Services: 8000-8999
# - API & Gateway Services: 9000-9999
# - Frontend/Dashboard Services: 3000-3999
# - Monitoring & Observability: 10000-19999
#
# Deployment Strategy:
# - Non-Docker: Services run on 'backend_port' (internal port)
# - Docker: Container runs on 'backend_port', exposed via 'external_port'
# - This ensures consistent internal communication regardless of deployment
#
# Format: service_name,external_port,backend_port,category,description
