# Hardcoded Rules Analysis - Current Implementation
## Analysis of Non-Persona Driven Logic

**Date:** 2025-08-27  
**Status:** ‚ùå **CRITICAL HARDCODING IDENTIFIED**  
**Priority:** HIGH - Convert All Logic to Persona-Driven

---

## Executive Summary

**FINDING**: Our current implementation has significant hardcoded rules and workflows that should be persona-driven. While we have excellent personas defined, the orchestration logic contains hardcoded workflows, phase definitions, and business rules that violate the pure persona-driven principle.

---

## ‚ùå HARDCODED ELEMENTS IDENTIFIED

### 1. **Hardcoded SDLC Phase Definitions** (CRITICAL)

**Location**: `complete_sdlc_orchestrator.py` lines 50-83
```python
self.sdlc_phases = {
    "requirements_analysis": [
        "requirement-concierge",
        "business-analyst"
    ],
    "solution_architecture": [
        "program-manager",
        "solution-architect", 
        "technical-architect"
    ],
    # ... more hardcoded phases
}
```

**Problem**: Phase structure and persona assignments are hardcoded instead of being persona-driven.

**Should Be**: A "Workflow Designer" or "SDLC Architect" persona should determine phases and persona assignments based on project requirements.

### 2. **Hardcoded Workflow Sequences** (CRITICAL)

**Location**: `complete_sdlc_orchestrator.py` lines 93-149
```python
# Phase 1: Requirements & Analysis
phase1_results = await self.execute_requirements_analysis_phase(...)
# Phase 2: Solution Architecture & Design  
phase2_results = await self.execute_solution_architecture_phase(...)
# Phase 3: Design Specification
phase3_results = await self.execute_design_specification_phase(...)
```

**Problem**: Workflow sequence is hardcoded instead of being determined by a persona.

**Should Be**: A "Workflow Orchestrator" persona should determine the sequence and dependencies dynamically.

### 3. **Hardcoded Context Scopes** (MEDIUM)

**Location**: Multiple files
```python
context_scope = "standard"  # Hardcoded
context_scope = "complete"  # Hardcoded
```

**Problem**: Context scope decisions are hardcoded.

**Should Be**: The "Central Knowledge Hub" persona should determine appropriate context scope based on persona needs and complexity.

### 4. **Hardcoded Team Configurations** (CRITICAL)

**Location**: `complete_sdlc_orchestrator.py` lines 339-376
```python
teams = team_config.get("teams", ["frontend", "backend", "platform"])  # Default hardcoded
```

**Problem**: Default team structures are hardcoded.

**Should Be**: A "Team Structure Architect" persona should determine optimal team structure based on project requirements.

### 5. **Hardcoded Verification Rules** (MEDIUM)

**Location**: `communication_aware_orchestrator.py`
```python
if verification.get("verified", False):  # Hardcoded boolean logic
    # Proceed with handoff
else:
    # Clarification needed
```

**Problem**: Verification decision logic is hardcoded.

**Should Be**: The "Verification Service" persona should make all verification decisions.

### 6. **Hardcoded Communication Personas** (MEDIUM)

**Location**: Multiple files
```python
self.knowledge_hub = "central-knowledge-hub"  # Hardcoded persona assignment
self.verification_service = "verification-service"  # Hardcoded
self.collaboration_manager = "collaborative-transition-manager"  # Hardcoded
```

**Problem**: Communication persona assignments are hardcoded.

**Should Be**: A "Communication Architect" persona should determine which communication personas are needed.

### 7. **Hardcoded Error Handling** (LOW)

**Location**: Multiple files
```python
if not isinstance(team_results[i], Exception):  # Hardcoded error handling
    # Success path
else:
    # Error path
```

**Problem**: Error handling logic is hardcoded.

**Should Be**: An "Error Handling Specialist" persona should determine error recovery strategies.

## üîÑ REQUIRED CHANGES TO ACHIEVE PURE PERSONA-DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE

### **Phase 1: Add Meta-Orchestration Personas**

#### 1. **Workflow Designer Persona**
```yaml
Role: "SDLC Workflow Design and Phase Planning Specialist"
Responsibilities:
  - Analyze project requirements and determine appropriate SDLC phases
  - Select appropriate personas for each phase based on project complexity
  - Design workflow sequences and dependencies
  - Adapt workflow based on project type (web app, mobile, enterprise, etc.)
Input: Project requirements, constraints, team capabilities
Output: Complete workflow design with phases, personas, and sequences
```

#### 2. **Team Structure Architect Persona**
```yaml
Role: "Multi-Team Structure Design and Coordination Planning Specialist" 
Responsibilities:
  - Analyze project scope and determine optimal team structure
  - Define team boundaries and responsibilities
  - Plan inter-team coordination strategies
  - Optimize team size and composition based on project needs
Input: Project scope, technology stack, timeline, available resources
Output: Team structure design with roles, responsibilities, and coordination plan
```

#### 3. **Communication Architect Persona**
```yaml
Role: "Communication Strategy Design and Anti-Pattern Prevention Specialist"
Responsibilities:
  - Determine required communication personas for project
  - Design communication patterns and protocols
  - Select appropriate verification and collaboration strategies
  - Adapt communication approach based on team size and complexity
Input: Team structure, project complexity, risk factors
Output: Communication architecture with persona assignments and protocols
```

### **Phase 2: Convert Hardcoded Logic to Persona Queries**

#### Before (Hardcoded):
```python
self.sdlc_phases = {
    "requirements_analysis": ["requirement-concierge"],
    "solution_architecture": ["program-manager", "solution-architect"]
}
```

#### After (Persona-Driven):
```python
async def get_workflow_design(self, requirements, constraints):
    workflow_design = await self.persona_client.call_persona(
        "workflow-designer",
        f"Design optimal SDLC workflow for: {requirements}",
        {"constraints": constraints, "project_type": "web_application"}
    )
    return self.parse_workflow_design(workflow_design)
```

#### Before (Hardcoded):
```python
teams = ["frontend", "backend", "platform"]
```

#### After (Persona-Driven):
```python
async def get_team_structure(self, project_scope, technology_stack):
    team_structure = await self.persona_client.call_persona(
        "team-structure-architect",
        f"Design optimal team structure for: {project_scope}",
        {"technology_stack": technology_stack, "timeline": timeline}
    )
    return self.parse_team_structure(team_structure)
```

### **Phase 3: Dynamic Workflow Execution**

#### Pure Persona-Driven Orchestrator:
```python
class PurePersonaDrivenOrchestrator:
    async def execute_project(self, requirements, constraints):
        # Step 1: Get workflow design from persona
        workflow = await self.get_workflow_design(requirements, constraints)
        
        # Step 2: Get team structure from persona  
        teams = await self.get_team_structure(workflow.scope, workflow.tech_stack)
        
        # Step 3: Get communication strategy from persona
        communication = await self.get_communication_strategy(teams, workflow.complexity)
        
        # Step 4: Execute workflow as designed by personas
        for phase in workflow.phases:
            await self.execute_phase_with_personas(phase)
```

## üö® CRITICAL PRIORITY

**The current implementation violates the pure persona-driven principle with significant hardcoded logic. This must be addressed to achieve true AI-driven workflow orchestration.**
