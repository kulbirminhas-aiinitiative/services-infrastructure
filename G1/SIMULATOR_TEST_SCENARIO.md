## 🔄 **G1 Workflow Design Process**

### **Step 1: Workflow Designer Analysis**
```yaml
workflow-designer_evaluation:
  Input_Analysis:
    - Requirement_Type: "Testing/Validation scenario"  
    - Target_Capability: "Security vulnerability detection and fixing"
    - Baseline_Code_Needed: true
    - Realistic_Context_Required: true
    - Validation_Criteria_Needed: true
  
  Decision: "Include simulator persona for security testing scenario"
  
  Workflow_Architecture:
    Phase_1: simulator → Generate web app with SQL injection vulnerabilities
    Phase_2: security-specialist → Identify and assess security vulnerabilities
    Phase_3: senior-developer → Implement security fixes
    Phase_4: qa-specialist → Validate fixes prevent SQL injection attacks
    Phase_5: technical-writer → Document security improvements and prevention
```

### **Step 2: Team Structure Architect Planning**
```yaml
team-structure-architect_design:
  Core_Team:
    - simulator: Generate vulnerable application baseline
    - security-specialist: Lead security analysis and validation
    - senior-developer: Implement secure coding fixes
    - backend-developer: Database security implementation
    - qa-specialist: Security testing and validation
    - technical-writer: Security documentation
  
  Communication_Flow:
    - simulator → central-knowledge-hub: Store generated app context
    - security-specialist ← central-knowledge-hub: Retrieve vulnerability context
    - Collaborative handoffs between all personas via verification-service
```

### **Step 3: Communication Architect Strategy**
```yaml
communication-architect_plan:
  Context_Preservation:
    - simulator provides complete vulnerable app context
    - Security vulnerability details maintained through workflow
    - Fix validation criteria preserved for testing
  
  Verification_Points:
    - Simulator output verified before security analysis
    - Security fix implementation verified before testing
    - Final validation confirmed before documentation
```

#### **Injected Vulnerabilities**

**1. SQL Injection in Login Authentication**
```javascript
// backend/routes/auth.js - VULNERABLE
app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;
  
  // VULNERABILITY: Direct string concatenation
  const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}' AND password = '${password}'`;
  
  db.query(query, (err, results) => {
    if (results.length > 0) {
      res.json({ success: true, user: results[0] });
    } else {
      res.json({ success: false, message: 'Invalid credentials' });
    }
  });
});
```

**2. SQL Injection in Project Search**
```javascript  
// backend/routes/projects.js - VULNERABLE
app.get('/projects/search', (req, res) => {
  const { term } = req.query;
  
  // VULNERABILITY: Unsanitized user input in WHERE clause
  const query = `SELECT * FROM projects WHERE name LIKE '%${term}%' OR description LIKE '%${term}%'`;
  
  db.query(query, (err, results) => {
    res.json(results);
  });
});
```

**3. SQL Injection in User Profile Updates**
```javascript
// backend/routes/users.js - VULNERABLE  
app.put('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  const { name, email, role } = req.body;
  
  // VULNERABILITY: Multiple injection points
  const query = `UPDATE users SET name='${name}', email='${email}', role='${role}' WHERE id=${id}`;
  
  db.query(query, (err, result) => {
    if (err) {
      res.status(500).json({ error: 'Update failed' });
    } else {
      res.json({ success: true });
    }
  });
});
```

#### **Realistic Business Context**
```yaml
User_Complaint:
  "Our project management app was flagged by a security audit. They found that 
   someone could potentially access other users' projects or even delete data 
   by manipulating the search functionality. We need this fixed immediately 
   as we're handling sensitive client project data."

Error_Logs:
  - "Suspicious database queries detected in access logs"
  - "Unusual project access patterns from user sessions"
  - "Database warning: Potentially harmful queries executed"

Business_Impact:
  - "Security audit compliance required for enterprise clients"
  - "Potential data breach risk affecting 10,000+ users"
  - "Client trust and contract renewals at stake"
  
Urgency: "HIGH - Security vulnerability in production system"
```

#### **Validation Criteria**
```yaml
Acceptance_Criteria:
  Security_Requirements:
    - All SQL queries must use parameterized statements
    - Input validation implemented for all user inputs
    - SQL injection attacks must be prevented
    - Error messages must not reveal database structure
  
  Functional_Requirements:
    - Login functionality continues to work normally
    - Project search returns correct results
    - User profile updates function properly
    - No legitimate user workflows are broken
  
  Testing_Requirements:
    - OWASP ZAP scan shows no SQL injection vulnerabilities
    - Manual SQL injection attempts must fail safely
    - Performance impact of fixes must be minimal (<5% degradation)
```

  Recommended_Fixes:
    - Implement parameterized queries for all database operations
    - Add input validation and sanitization
    - Implement proper error handling without information disclosure
    - Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
```

### **Phase 2: Implementation (senior-developer + backend-developer)**
```yaml
Implementation_Strategy:
  Database_Layer_Fixes:
    - Replace string concatenation with prepared statements
    - Implement query parameter binding
    - Add database connection security configuration
  
  Application_Layer_Fixes:  
    - Input validation middleware
    - SQL injection prevention patterns
    - Secure error handling
    - Logging for security monitoring
```

**Fixed Login Authentication:**
```javascript
// backend/routes/auth.js - SECURE VERSION
app.post('/login', [
  body('username').isLength({ min: 3 }).trim().escape(),
  body('password').isLength({ min: 6 })
], (req, res) => {
  const errors = validationResult(req);
  if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
    return res.status(400).json({ success: false, message: 'Invalid input' });
  }
  
  const { username, password } = req.body;
  
  // SECURE: Parameterized query
  const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?';
  
  db.query(query, [username, password], (err, results) => {
    if (err) {
      logger.error('Database error during login', { error: err.message });
      return res.status(500).json({ success: false, message: 'Login failed' });
    }
    
    if (results.length > 0) {
      res.json({ success: true, user: { id: results[0].id, username: results[0].username } });
    } else {
      res.json({ success: false, message: 'Invalid credentials' });
    }
  });
});
```

### **Phase 3: Security Validation (qa-specialist + security-specialist)**
```yaml
Testing_Results:
  OWASP_ZAP_Scan:
    - SQL injection vulnerabilities: 0 (previously 3)
    - Security rating: A (previously F)
    - No critical or high-severity issues found
  
  Manual_Testing:
    - Login bypass attempts: All failed safely
    - Data exfiltration attempts: Blocked by parameterized queries
    - Error message testing: No database information disclosed
  
  Performance_Impact:
    - Response time change: +2ms average (within acceptable range)
    - Database query efficiency: Improved due to prepared statements
    - Memory usage: No significant change
```

### **Phase 4: Documentation (technical-writer)**
```yaml
Security_Documentation:
  Security_Fixes_Applied:
    - Comprehensive SQL injection vulnerability remediation
    - Implementation of parameterized queries across all endpoints
    - Input validation and sanitization framework
    - Secure error handling without information disclosure
  
  Prevention_Guidelines:
