## ‚úÖ HARDCODING ELIMINATION VERIFICATION

### **1. ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ SDLC Phase Definitions** (RESOLVED)

**Previously Hardcoded:**
```python
# complete_sdlc_orchestrator.py - HARDCODED PHASES
self.sdlc_phases = {
    "requirements_analysis": ["requirement-concierge"],
    "solution_architecture": ["solution-architect"], 
    # ... hardcoded phase definitions
}
```

**Now 100% Persona-Driven:**
```python
# pure_persona_driven_orchestrator.py - PERSONA-DRIVEN
workflow_design = await self.design_workflow(requirements, project_context)
phases = self.parse_workflow_phases(workflow_design)
# All phases come from workflow-designer persona, zero hardcoding
```

### **2. ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ Workflow Sequences** (RESOLVED)

**Previously Hardcoded:**
```python
# HARDCODED SEQUENCE
phase1_results = await self.execute_requirements_analysis_phase(...)
phase2_results = await self.execute_solution_architecture_phase(...)
```

**Now 100% Persona-Driven:**
```python
# PERSONA-DRIVEN SEQUENCE
for phase in phases:  # phases designed by workflow-designer persona
    phase_result = await self.execute_phase(phase, ...)
```

### **3. ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ Team Structures** (RESOLVED)

**Previously Hardcoded:**
```python
# HARDCODED TEAMS
teams = ["frontend", "backend", "platform"]
```

**Now 100% Persona-Driven:**
```python
# PERSONA-DRIVEN TEAMS
team_structure = await self.design_team_structure(workflow_design, project_scope)
teams = self.parse_team_assignments(team_structure)
```

### **4. ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ Communication Patterns** (RESOLVED)

**Previously Hardcoded:**
```python
# HARDCODED COMMUNICATION PERSONAS
self.knowledge_hub = "central-knowledge-hub"  # Hardcoded assignment
```

**Now 100% Persona-Driven:**
```python
# PERSONA-DRIVEN COMMUNICATION
communication_strategy = await self.design_communication_strategy(workflow_design, team_structure)
# All communication patterns designed by communication-architect persona
```

### **5. ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ Context Scopes** (RESOLVED)

**Previously Hardcoded:**
```python
context_scope = "standard"  # Hardcoded
```

**Now 100% Persona-Driven:**
```python
# Context scope decisions made by central-knowledge-hub persona
persona_context = await self.get_context_from_hub(req_id, persona)
```

### **6. ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ Business Rules** (RESOLVED)

**Previously Hardcoded:**
```python
if verification.get("verified", False):  # Hardcoded boolean logic
```

**Now 100% Persona-Driven:**
```python
# All verification decisions made by verification-service persona
verification = await self.verify_understanding(...)
```
