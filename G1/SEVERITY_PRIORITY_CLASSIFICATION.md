## ðŸŽ¯ **Automated Classification Algorithm**

### **AI-Powered Assessment Process**

#### **Step 1: Initial Classification**
```yaml
Input_Analysis:
  - Requirement text parsing
  - Keyword extraction and mapping
  - Context analysis
  - Historical pattern matching

Classification_AI_Prompt:
  "Analyze this requirement and classify it across these dimensions:
   - Severity (P0-P4) based on system impact
   - Business Priority (BP1-BP4) based on business value
   - Technical Priority (TP1-TP4) based on technical impact
   - Development Complexity (DC1-DC5) based on implementation effort
   - Technical Risk (TR1-TR5) based on implementation challenges"

Output:
  - Initial classification scores
  - Confidence levels for each dimension
  - Reasoning for classifications
  - Potential edge cases or considerations
```

#### **Step 2: Multi-Persona Validation**
```yaml
Validation_Process:
  Business_Analyst: Validates business priority and impact
  Technical_Architect: Validates technical complexity and risk
  Project_Manager: Validates timeline and resource implications
  QA_Specialist: Validates testing complexity and risk
  Security_Specialist: Validates security implications

Consensus_Building:
  - Each persona provides independent assessment
  - Disagreements trigger discussion and re-evaluation
  - Final classification requires majority agreement
  - Edge cases escalated to senior personas
```

#### **Step 3: Dynamic Adjustment**
```yaml
Context_Factors:
  Current_System_Load:
    - Existing high-priority items
    - Team capacity and availability
    - Current sprint commitments
    - Resource constraints
