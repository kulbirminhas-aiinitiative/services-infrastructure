Complex Website Workflow Test
============================

Test the pure persona-driven workflow with a complex website requirement
to ensure proper requirement translation and code generation.

This test validates:
1. Requirement structuring and sharing between personas
2. Requirement fidelity throughout the workflow
3. Final code generation alignment with original requirements
4. Communication effectiveness across persona handoffs
